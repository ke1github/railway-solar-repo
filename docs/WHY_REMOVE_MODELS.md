# Why We're Removing MongoDB Models

## Current Issues

1. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The MongoDB models add an extra layer of complexity that's not needed for our current development phase.

2. **Development Friction**: Setting up and maintaining a MongoDB instance for local development creates friction and slows down onboarding.

3. **Testing Challenges**: Unit and integration tests require mock MongoDB instances or complex setup procedures.

4. **Flexibility Limitations**: The current architecture tightly couples our application to MongoDB, making it difficult to switch or integrate with other data sources.

5. **Schema Evolution**: Changes to database schemas require careful migration planning, even during rapid development phases.

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Simplified Development**: The new data adapter pattern with mock data allows for development without any database setup.

2. **Improved Testing**: Testing becomes simpler with predictable, in-memory data.

3. **Flexibility**: The adapter pattern allows us to easily switch between different data sources (mock data, Appwrite, MongoDB, etc.) without changing application code.

4. **Cleaner Separation of Concerns**: The data service layer clearly separates business logic from data access.

5. **Future-Proof Architecture**: When we're ready to integrate with Appwrite, we only need to implement a new adapter without changing the rest of the application.

## Migration Strategy

We're taking a careful, step-by-step approach:

1. **Create Data Models**: Define clear interfaces for our data entities
2. **Implement Data Adapter**: Create a flexible adapter pattern for data operations
3. **Develop Data Service**: Build a domain-specific service layer on top of the adapter
4. **Initialize Mock Data**: Provide realistic test data for development
5. **Migrate Action Files**: Update server actions to use the new data service
6. **Update Components**: Ensure frontend components use the new data models
7. **Remove MongoDB Models**: Once everything is working, safely remove the MongoDB models
8. **Document New Architecture**: Provide clear documentation for the new approach

This approach allows us to maintain functionality while transitioning to a more flexible, development-friendly architecture that will make future Appwrite integration much smoother.
